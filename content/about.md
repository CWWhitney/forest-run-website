## Our Story

Forest Run Collective was founded with a simple vision: to create a sanctuary where people can recover and reconnect with nature. Our 2-acre property sits adjacent to the Camden Snow Bowl and connects to an extensive trail network that draws runners and outdoor enthusiasts from across New England.

Nothing is happening yet — we are still building!

The only thing here right now is a sauna. If you would like to use the sauna or are interested in learning more, please contact us.
