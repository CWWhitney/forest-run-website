## Our Story

Forest Run Collective was founded with a simple vision: to create a sanctuary where people can recover and reconnect with nature. Our 2-acre property sits adjacent to the Camden Snow Bowl and connects to an extensive trail network that draws runners and outdoor enthusiasts from across New England.

### Our Facilities

**Sauna**: Traditional wood-fired design, cold plunge. A sanctuary for recovery, resilience, and connection.

**The Cabin**: A rustic, comfortable 2-person retreat with wood stove, hot shower, and views of the forest canopy.

**Trails**: Direct access to 15+ miles of maintained trails in the Camden Hills for those interested in guided running or hiking.

**Camping**: 2-3 premium tent sites on our property, intentionally minimal—no RVs, no generators, no noise.

### The Non-Profit Connection

Forest Run Collective LLC is wholly owned by the **Forest Run Non-Profit (501(c)(3))**—dedicated to:

- Increasing forest access and appreciation among Maine youth and locals
- Trail maintenance and conservation of the Camden Hills
- Training programs: wilderness skills, trail work
- Service-based learning that builds community and develops character
