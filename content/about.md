## Our Story

Forest Run Collective was founded with a simple vision: to create a sanctuary where people can recover, reconnect with nature, and experience authentic thermal wellness through our traditional wood-fired sauna.

We're rooted in the Camden Hills of Maine—a landscape shaped by generations of trail-builders, runners, and stewards. Our 2-acre property sits adjacent to the Camden Snow Bowl and connects to an extensive trail network that draws runners and outdoor enthusiasts from across New England.

### Who We Are

We're sauna practitioners, wellness advocates, and forest stewards who believe that authentic thermal experiences and nature immersion aren't luxuries—they're essential for health and resilience.

Our team includes:
- **Cory Whitney** - Founder & Operations
- Trained sauna and thermal therapy practitioners
- Trail guides certified in forest ecology and trail safety
- Community volunteers dedicated to trail maintenance

### Our Values

**Trail Stewardship**: We maintain our trails to a high standard and contribute to regional trail conservation efforts.

**Community First**: Profits from our business directly support our non-profit mission—youth development and forest access.

**Authentic Wellness**: We offer genuine, grounded experiences, not marketing hype. Everything we do has a reason rooted in science and practice.

**Accessibility**: We keep costs reasonable and offer discounted visits for community groups, youth, and underrepresented populations in outdoor recreation.

### The Non-Profit Connection

Forest Run Collective LLC is wholly owned by the **Forest Run Non-Profit (501(c)(3))**—dedicated to:

- Increasing forest access and appreciation among Maine youth and locals
- Trail maintenance and conservation of the Camden Hills
- Training programs: wilderness skills, trail work, running technique
- Service-based learning that builds community and develops character

100% of our business profits support these programs.

### Our Facilities

**Sauna**: Traditional wood-fired design, cold plunge, tea service. A sanctuary for recovery, resilience, and connection.

**The Cabin**: A rustic, comfortable 2-person retreat with wood stove, hot shower, and views of the forest canopy.

**Trails**: Direct access to 15+ miles of maintained trails in the Camden Hills for those interested in guided running or hiking.

**Camping**: 2-3 premium tent sites on our property, intentionally minimal—no RVs, no generators, no noise.
